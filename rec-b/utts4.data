( arctic_b0001 "Gad, do I remember it." )
( arctic_b0002 "You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl." )
( arctic_b0003 "I can see that knife now." )
( arctic_b0004 "When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die." )
( arctic_b0005 "His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's." )
( arctic_b0006 "He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door." )
( arctic_b0007 "Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill." )
( arctic_b0008 "Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile." )
( arctic_b0009 "I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap." )
( arctic_b0010 "He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger." )
( arctic_b0011 "His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face." )
( arctic_b0012 "Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him." )
( arctic_b0013 "Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them." )
( arctic_b0014 "Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout." )
( arctic_b0015 "They robbed me a few years later." )
( arctic_b0016 "He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it." )
( arctic_b0017 "Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected." )
( arctic_b0018 "I was completely lost in my work." )
( arctic_b0019 "His slim hands gripped the edges of the table." )
( arctic_b0020 "He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue." )
( arctic_b0021 "Philip dropped back into his chair." )
( arctic_b0022 "If I was out of the game it would be easily made." )
( arctic_b0023 "MacDougall, my engineer, believes it." )
( arctic_b0024 "It is growing, every day, every hour." )
( arctic_b0025 "Now, you understand." )
( arctic_b0026 "You have associated with some of these men." )
( arctic_b0027 "And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight." )
( arctic_b0028 "Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation." )
( arctic_b0029 "All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto." )
( arctic_b0030 "Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips." )
( arctic_b0031 "Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil." )
( arctic_b0032 "He caught himself with a jerk." )
( arctic_b0033 "How does your wager look now." )
( arctic_b0034 "He confessed that the sketch had startled him." )
( arctic_b0035 "After all, the picture was only a resemblance." )
( arctic_b0036 "He wondered, too, where Roscoe was." )
( arctic_b0037 "Philip knew that she was not an Indian." )
( arctic_b0038 "In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things." )
( arctic_b0039 "Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him." )
( arctic_b0040 "The thought set his blood tingling." )
( arctic_b0041 "But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow." )
( arctic_b0042 "Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief." )
( arctic_b0043 "It won't be for sale." )
( arctic_b0044 "For a few moments he ate in silence." )
( arctic_b0045 "Philip did not pursue the subject." )
( arctic_b0046 "Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him." )
( arctic_b0047 "Suppose you saw me at work through the window." )
( arctic_b0048 "He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two." )
( arctic_b0049 "There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words." )
( arctic_b0050 "All this day Gregson remained in the cabin." )
( arctic_b0051 "The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson." )
( arctic_b0052 "The flush was gone from her face." )
( arctic_b0053 "That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed." )
( arctic_b0054 "He understood the meaning of the look." )
( arctic_b0055 "She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before." )
( arctic_b0056 "I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson." )
( arctic_b0057 "They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers." )
( arctic_b0058 "We must achieve our own salvation." )
( arctic_b0059 "In moments of mental energy Philip was restless." )
( arctic_b0060 "He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two." )
( arctic_b0061 "Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence." )
( arctic_b0062 "Now it was missing from the wall." )
( arctic_b0063 "He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait." )
( arctic_b0064 "I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight." )
( arctic_b0065 "Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip." )
( arctic_b0066 "If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen." )
( arctic_b0067 "Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight." )
( arctic_b0068 "Only the chance sound had led him to observe them." )
( arctic_b0069 "Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre." )
( arctic_b0070 "There was no chance to fire without hitting him." )
( arctic_b0071 "There was no answer from the other side." )
( arctic_b0072 "Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him." )
( arctic_b0073 "With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone." )
( arctic_b0074 "Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive." )
( arctic_b0075 "In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution." )
( arctic_b0076 "Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him." )
( arctic_b0077 "It is the nearest refuge." )
( arctic_b0078 "There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice." )
( arctic_b0079 "The truth of it set Jeanne quivering." )
( arctic_b0080 "Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon." )
( arctic_b0081 "You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock." )
( arctic_b0082 "He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break." )
( arctic_b0083 "In it there was something that was almost tragedy." )
( arctic_b0084 "Your face is red with blood." )
( arctic_b0085 "Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank." )
( arctic_b0086 "He can care for himself." )
( arctic_b0087 "They will search for us between their camp and Churchill." )
( arctic_b0088 "Until I die, he exclaimed." )
( arctic_b0089 "Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils." )
( arctic_b0090 "The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed." )
( arctic_b0091 "For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking." )
( arctic_b0092 "I want to die in it." )
( arctic_b0093 "Darkness hid him from Jeanne." )
( arctic_b0094 "And yet if she came he had no words to say." )
( arctic_b0095 "He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day." )
( arctic_b0096 "Within himself he called it no longer his own." )
( arctic_b0097 "Besides, that noise makes me deaf." )
( arctic_b0098 "Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe." )
( arctic_b0099 "Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks." )
( arctic_b0100 "There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne." )
( arctic_b0101 "You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win." )
( arctic_b0102 "I'll only be in the way." )
( arctic_b0103 "He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips." )
( arctic_b0104 "Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body." )
( arctic_b0105 "I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows." )
( arctic_b0106 "For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face." )
( arctic_b0107 "He was sure, now, of but few things." )
( arctic_b0108 "It was a miracle, and I owe you my life." )
( arctic_b0109 "Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him." )
( arctic_b0110 "Such men believe, when they come together." )
( arctic_b0111 "The journey was continued at dawn." )
( arctic_b0112 "Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock." )
( arctic_b0113 "There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now." )
( arctic_b0114 "He moved his position, and the illusion was gone." )
( arctic_b0115 "For two hours not a word passed between them." )
( arctic_b0116 "I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip." )
( arctic_b0117 "That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer." )
( arctic_b0118 "We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call." )
( arctic_b0119 "Billinger may arrive in time." )
( arctic_b0120 "There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette." )
( arctic_b0121 "I want my men to work by themselves." )
( arctic_b0122 "Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe." )
( arctic_b0123 "Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men." )
( arctic_b0124 "Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times." )
( arctic_b0125 "It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear." )
( arctic_b0126 "Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast." )
( arctic_b0127 "He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman." )
( arctic_b0128 "Philip bent low over Pierre." )
( arctic_b0129 "Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill." )
( arctic_b0130 "She saw the answer in his face." )
( arctic_b0131 "Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you." )
( arctic_b0132 "There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand." )
( arctic_b0133 "There followed a roar that shook the earth." )
( arctic_b0134 "Blind with rage, he darted in." )
( arctic_b0135 "In it was the joy of life." )
( arctic_b0136 "Swiftly his eyes measured the situation." )
( arctic_b0137 "But this little defect did not worry him." )
( arctic_b0138 "And then, steadily, he began to chew." )
( arctic_b0139 "Together they ate the rabbit." )
( arctic_b0140 "They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world." )
( arctic_b0141 "It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits." )
( arctic_b0142 "Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now." )
( arctic_b0143 "It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it." )
( arctic_b0144 "But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart." )
( arctic_b0145 "Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest." )
( arctic_b0146 "After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment." )
( arctic_b0147 "Had it struck squarely it would have killed him." )
( arctic_b0148 "The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce." )
( arctic_b0149 "Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur." )
( arctic_b0150 "And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear." )
( arctic_b0151 "It was steel, a fisher trap." )
( arctic_b0152 "OW, a wild dog, he growled." )
( arctic_b0153 "He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home." )
( arctic_b0154 "That is the strange part of it." )
( arctic_b0155 "His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor." )
( arctic_b0156 "For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight." )
( arctic_b0157 "In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle." )
( arctic_b0158 "She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms." )
( arctic_b0159 "His teeth shut with a last click." )
( arctic_b0160 "It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators." )
( arctic_b0161 "In a flash he was on his feet, facing him." )
( arctic_b0162 "He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders." )
( arctic_b0163 "The moon had already begun its westward decline." )
( arctic_b0164 "They laughed like two happy children." )
( arctic_b0165 "He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back." )
( arctic_b0166 "Fast, but endure." )
( arctic_b0167 "A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came." )
( arctic_b0168 "The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart." )
( arctic_b0169 "He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them." )
( arctic_b0170 "Then he shouted, Shut up." )
( arctic_b0171 "He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair." )
( arctic_b0172 "On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded." )
( arctic_b0173 "To these he gave castor oil." )
( arctic_b0174 "Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing." )
( arctic_b0175 "Sheldon glanced at the thermometer." )
( arctic_b0176 "I'll see to poor Hughie." )
( arctic_b0177 "Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering." )
( arctic_b0178 "Also, I want information." )
( arctic_b0179 "Let them go out and eat with my boys." )
( arctic_b0180 "I, I beg pardon, he drawled." )
( arctic_b0181 "And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt." )
( arctic_b0182 "I was in New York when the crash came." )
( arctic_b0183 "No, I did not fall among thieves." )
( arctic_b0184 "Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips." )
( arctic_b0185 "Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me." )
( arctic_b0186 "I can't go elsewhere, by your own account." )
( arctic_b0187 "Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation." )
( arctic_b0188 "He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips." )
( arctic_b0189 "That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals." )
( arctic_b0190 "Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off." )
( arctic_b0191 "He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons." )
( arctic_b0192 "Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged." )
( arctic_b0193 "So was Packard's finish suicide." )
( arctic_b0194 "Joan cried, with shining eyes." )
( arctic_b0195 "Nobody knows how the natives got them." )
( arctic_b0196 "How can you manage all alone, Mr Young." )
( arctic_b0197 "The planters are already considering the matter." )
( arctic_b0198 "I use great trouble advisedly." )
( arctic_b0199 "Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time." )
( arctic_b0200 "We leave the eventuality to time and law." )
( arctic_b0201 "I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe." )
( arctic_b0202 "Society is shaken to its foundations." )
( arctic_b0203 "A month in Australia would finish me." )
( arctic_b0204 "Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods." )
( arctic_b0205 "You were destroying my life." )
( arctic_b0206 "Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery." )
( arctic_b0207 "I'm as good as a man, she urged." )
